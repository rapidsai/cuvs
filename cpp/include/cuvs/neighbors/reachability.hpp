/**

/**
 * Constructs a mutual reachability graph, which is a k-nearest neighbors
 * graph projected into mutual reachability space using the following
 * function for each data point, where core_distance is the distance
 * to the kth neighbor: max(core_distance(a), core_distance(b), d(a, b))
 *
 * Unfortunately, points in the tails of the pdf (e.g. in sparse regions
 * of the space) can have very large neighborhoods, which will impact
 * nearby neighborhoods. Because of this, it's possible that the
 * radius for points in the main mass, which might have a very small
 * radius initially, to expand very large. As a result, the initial
 * knn which was used to compute the core distances may no longer
 * capture the actual neighborhoods after projection into mutual
 * reachability space.
 *
 * For the experimental version, we execute the knn twice- once
 * to compute the radii (core distances) and again to capture
 * the final neighborhoods. Future iterations of this algorithm
 * will work improve upon this "exact" version, by using
 * more specialized data structures, such as space-partitioning
 * structures. It has also been shown that approximate nearest
 * neighbors can yield reasonable neighborhoods as the
 * data sizes increase.
 *
 * @param[in] handle raft handle for resource reuse
 * @param[in] X input data points (size m * n)
 * @param[in] min_samples this neighborhood will be selected for core distances
 * @param[out] indptr CSR indptr of output knn graph (size m + 1)
 * @param[out] core_dists output core distances array (size m)
 * @param[out] out COO object, uninitialized on entry, on exit it stores the
 *             (symmetrized) maximum reachability distance for the k nearest
 *             neighbors.
 * @param[in] metric distance metric to use, default Euclidean
 * @param[in] alpha weight applied when internal distance is chosen for
 *            mutual reachability (value of 1.0 disables the weighting)
