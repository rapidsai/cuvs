 * @brief Computes epsilon neighborhood for the given distance metric and ball size.
 * The epsilon neighbors is represented by a dense boolean adjacency matrix of size m * n and
 * an array of degrees for each vertex, which can be used as a compressed sparse row (CSR)
 * indptr array.
 *
 * Currently, only L2Unexpanded (L2-squared) distance metric is supported. Other metrics will
 * throw an exception.
