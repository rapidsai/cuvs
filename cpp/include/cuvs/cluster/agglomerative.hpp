   * The all-neighbors graph construction algorithm enables building the mutual reachability
   * graph on datasets larger than device memory by:
   *   1. Partitioning the dataset into overlapping clusters,
   *   2. Computing local KNN graphs within each cluster, and
   *   3. Merging the local graphs into a single global graph.
   *
   * Key fields:
   * - graph_build_params: Selects the KNN construction method (Brute Force or NN Descent)
   *   and controls algorithm-specific parameters.
   *
   * - n_clusters: Number of partitions (batches) to split the data into. Larger `n_clusters`
   *   reduces memory usage but may reduce accuracy if `overlap_factor` is too low.
   *   Recommended starting value: `n_clusters = 4`. Increase progressively (4 → 8 → 16 ...)
   *   to reduce memory usage at the cost of some accuracy. This is independent of `overlap_factor`
   *   as long as `overlap_factor < n_clusters`.
   *
   * - overlap_factor: Number of nearest clusters each data point is assigned to. Higher
   *   `overlap_factor` improves accuracy at the cost of memory and performance.
   *   Recommended starting value: `overlap_factor = 2`. Increase gradually (2 → 3 → 4 ...)
   *   for better accuracy with higher device memory usage.
   *
   * - metric: Distance metric to use when computing nearest neighbors.
