# cuVS Java API


cuVS Java API provides a Java based simple, efficient, and a robust vector search API.

> [!CAUTION]
> This contains an experimental APIs and may change in upcoming releases.

## Prerequisites

- [CuVS libraries](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cuvs/stable/build/#build-from-source)
- [maven 3.9.6 or above](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [JDK 22](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/22/)
- [jextract for JDK 22](https://jdk.java.net/jextract/) (If not already installed, the build script downloads it)


## Building

The libcuvs C and C++ libraries are needed for this API. If libcuvs libraries have not been built and installed, use `./build.sh libcuvs java` in the top level directory to build this API.

Alternatively, if libcuvs libraries are already built and you just want to build this API, please
do `./build.sh java` in the top level directory or just do `./build.sh` in this directory.

## Testing

Run `./build.sh --run-java-tests` from this directory.

To run a single test:
```sh
cd cuvs-java/
mvn verify -Dintegration-test=com.nvidia.cuvs.CagraBuildAndSearchIT
```
Be sure to set (manually, if needed) your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include the directory with the appropriate (matching)
version of `libcuvs.so`.
Also, ensure that your panama bindings are up-to-date. They can be re-generated by running:
```sh
./panama-bindings/generate-bindings.sh
```


## Examples

A few starter examples of CAGRA, HNSW, and Bruteforce indexing and searching are provided in the `examples` directory.
