# NN Descent

_Source header: `cuvs/neighbors/nn_descent.hpp`_

## The nn-descent algorithm parameters.

<a id="neighbors-nn-descent-dist-comp-dtype"></a>
### neighbors::nn_descent::DIST_COMP_DTYPE

Dtype to use for distance computation

```cpp
enum class DIST_COMP_DTYPE { ... };
```

**Values**

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AUTO` | `0` | Automatically determine the best dtype for distance computation based on the dataset dimensions. |
| `FP32` | `1` | Use fp32 distance computation for better precision at the cost of performance and memory usage. |
| `FP16` | `2` | Use fp16 distance computation. |

<a id="neighbors-nn-descent-index-params"></a>
### neighbors::nn_descent::index_params

Parameters used to build an nn-descent index

```cpp
struct index_params : cuvs::neighbors::index_params { ... };
```

**Fields**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `graph_degree` | `size_t` | For an input dataset of dimensions (N, D), determines the final dimensions of the all-neighbors knn graph which turns out to be of dimensions (N, graph_degree) |
| `intermediate_graph_degree` | `size_t` | Internally, nn-descent builds an all-neighbors knn graph of dimensions (N, intermediate_graph_degree) before selecting the final `graph_degree` neighbors. It's recommended that `intermediate_graph_degree` &gt;= 1.5 * graph_degree |
| `max_iterations` | `size_t` | The number of iterations that nn-descent will refine the graph for. More iterations produce a better quality graph at cost of performance |
| `termination_threshold` | `float` | The delta at which nn-descent will terminate its iterations |
| `return_distances` | `bool` | Boolean to decide whether to return distances array |
| `dist_comp_dtype` | [`DIST_COMP_DTYPE`](/api-reference/cpp-api-neighbors-nn-descent#neighbors-nn-descent-dist-comp-dtype) | dtype to use for distance computation. Defaults to `AUTO` which automatically determines the best dtype for distance computation based on the dataset dimensions. Use `FP32` for better precision at the cost of performance and memory usage. This option is only valid when data type is fp32. Use `FP16` for better performance and memory usage at the cost of precision. |
