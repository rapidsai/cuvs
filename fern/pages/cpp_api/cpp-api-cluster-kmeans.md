### cuvs::cluster::kmeans::fit

Find clusters with k-means algorithm using batched processing of host data.

```cpp
void fit(raft::resources const& handle,

TODO: Evaluate replacing the extent type with int64_t. Reference issue: https://github.com/rapidsai/cuvs/issues/1961 This overload supports out-of-core computation where the dataset resides on the host.

### helpers::find_k

Automatically find the optimal value of k using a binary search.

```cpp
void find_k(raft::resources const& handle,
raft::device_matrix_view<const float, int> X,
raft::host_scalar_view<int> best_k,
raft::host_scalar_view<float> inertia,
raft::host_scalar_view<int> n_iter,
int kmax,
int kmin    = 1,
int maxiter = 100,
float tol   = 1e-3);
```

This method maximizes the Calinski-Harabasz Index while minimizing the per-cluster inertia.

**Parameters**

| Name | Direction | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `handle` |  | `raft::resources const&` | raft handle |
| `X` |  | `raft::device_matrix_view<const float, int>` | input observations (shape n_samples, n_dims) |
| `best_k` |  | `raft::host_scalar_view<int>` | best k found from binary search |
| `inertia` |  | `raft::host_scalar_view<float>` | inertia of best k found |
| `n_iter` |  | `raft::host_scalar_view<int>` | number of iterations used to find best k |
| `kmax` |  | `int` | maximum k to try in search |
| `kmin` |  | `int` | minimum k to try in search (should be &gt;= 1) Default: `1`. |
| `maxiter` |  | `int` | maximum number of iterations to run Default: `100`. |
| `tol` |  | `float` | tolerance for early stopping convergence Default: `1e-3`. |

**Returns**

`void`
