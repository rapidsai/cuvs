# cuVS: Vector Search and Clustering on the GPU

cuVS is a GPU-accelerated library for vector search, clustering, and preprocessing. It provides both core building blocks for constructing new algorithms and end-to-end algorithms that can be used directly or through a growing list of [integrations](integrations.md).

## What is cuVS?

cuVS contains state-of-the-art implementations of several algorithms for running approximate and exact nearest neighbors and clustering on the GPU. It can be used directly or through the various databases and other libraries that have integrated it. The primary goal of cuVS is to simplify the use of GPUs for vector similarity search, preprocessing, and clustering. For a broader introduction, start with the [introductory materials](introduction.md) in Getting Started.

Vector search is an information retrieval method for finding semantically similar items in embedding spaces, especially when working with multimedia embeddings created from unstructured data. It is also used in *data mining and machine learning* tasks and comprises an important step in many *clustering* and *visualization* algorithms like [UMAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00325), [t-SNE](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/), K-means, and [HDBSCAN](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_hdbscan_works.html).

Finally, faster vector search enables interactions between dense vectors and graphs. Converting a pile of dense vectors into nearest neighbors graphs unlocks the entire world of graph analysis algorithms, such as those found in [GraphBLAS](https://graphblas.org/) and [cuGraph](https://github.com/rapidsai/cugraph).

## Where is cuVS used?

These are common places where vector search appears. For more examples, see [Use-cases](use_cases.md) and [Integrations](integrations.md).

## Why cuVS?

There are several benefits to using cuVS and GPUs for vector search, including

1. Fast index build
2. Latency critical and high throughput search
3. [Parameter tuning](tuning_guide.md)
4. Cost savings
5. Interoperability (build on GPU, deploy on CPU)
6. Multiple language support
7. Building blocks for composing new or accelerating existing algorithms

In addition to the items above, cuVS shoulders the responsibility of keeping non-trivial accelerated code up to date as new NVIDIA architectures and CUDA versions are released. This provides a delightful development experience, guaranteeing that any libraries, databases, or applications built on top of it will always be receiving the best performance and scale.

## cuVS Technology Stack

cuVS is built on top of the RAPIDS RAFT library of high performance machine learning primitives and provides all the necessary routines for vector search and clustering on the GPU.
