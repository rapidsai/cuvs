# HNSW

_Python module: `cuvs.neighbors.hnsw`_

## AceParams

```python
cdef class AceParams
```

Parameters for ACE (Augmented Core Extraction) graph build for HNSW.

ACE enables building HNSW indices for datasets too large to fit in GPU
memory by partitioning the dataset and building sub-indices for each
partition independently.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npartitions` | `int, default = 0 (optional)` | Number of partitions for ACE partitioned build. When set to 0 (default), the number of partitions is automatically derived based on available host and GPU memory to maximize partition size while ensuring the build fits in memory.<br /><br />Small values might improve recall but potentially degrade performance and increase memory usage. Partitions should not be too small to prevent issues in KNN graph construction. The partition size is on average 2 * (n_rows / npartitions) * dim * sizeof(T). 2 is because of the core and augmented vectors. Please account for imbalance in the partition sizes (up to 3x in our tests).<br /><br />If the specified number of partitions results in partitions that exceed available memory, the value will be automatically increased to fit memory constraints and a warning will be issued. |
| `build_dir` | `string, default = "/tmp/hnsw_ace_build" (optional)` | Directory to store ACE build artifacts (KNN graph, optimized graph). Used when `use_disk` is true or when the graph does not fit in memory. |
| `use_disk` | `bool, default = False (optional)` | Whether to use disk-based storage for ACE build. When true, enables disk-based operations for memory-efficient graph construction. |
| `max_host_memory_gb` | `float, default = 0 (optional)` | Maximum host memory to use for ACE build in GiB. When set to 0 (default), uses available host memory. Useful for testing or when running alongside other memory-intensive processes. |
| `max_gpu_memory_gb` | `float, default = 0 (optional)` | Maximum GPU memory to use for ACE build in GiB. When set to 0 (default), uses available GPU memory. Useful for testing or when running alongside other memory-intensive processes. |

**Constructor**

```python
def __init__(self, *, npartitions=0, build_dir="/tmp/hnsw_ace_build", use_disk=False, max_host_memory_gb=0, max_gpu_memory_gb=0)
```

## IndexParams

```python
cdef class IndexParams
```

Parameters to build index for HNSW nearest neighbor search

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hierarchy` | `string, default = "gpu" (optional)` | The hierarchy of the HNSW index. Valid values are ["none", "cpu", "gpu"]. - "none": No hierarchy is built. - "cpu": Hierarchy is built using CPU. - "gpu": Hierarchy is built using GPU. |
| `ef_construction` | `int, default = 200 (optional)` | Maximum number of candidate list size used during construction when hierarchy is `cpu`. |
| `num_threads` | `int, default = 0 (optional)` | Number of CPU threads used to increase construction parallelism when hierarchy is `cpu` or `gpu`. When the value is 0, the number of threads is automatically determined to the maximum number of threads available. NOTE: When hierarchy is `gpu`, while the majority of the work is done on the GPU, initialization of the HNSW index itself and some other work is parallelized with the help of CPU threads. |
| `M` | `int, default = 32 (optional)` | HNSW M parameter: number of bi-directional links per node (used when building with ACE). graph_degree = m * 2, intermediate_graph_degree = m * 3. |
| `metric` | `string, default = "sqeuclidean" (optional)` | Distance metric to use. Valid values: ["sqeuclidean", "inner_product"] |
| `ace_params` | `AceParams, default = None (optional)` | ACE parameters for building HNSW index using ACE algorithm. If set, enables the build() function to use ACE for index construction. |

## load

`@auto_sync_resources`

```python
def load(IndexParams index_params, filename, dim, dtype, metric="sqeuclidean", resources=None)
```

Loads an HNSW index.
If the index was constructed with `hnsw.IndexParams(hierarchy="none")`,
then the loaded index is immutable and can only be searched by the hnswlib
wrapper in cuVS, as the format is not compatible with the original hnswlib.
However, if the index was constructed with
`hnsw.IndexParams(hierarchy="cpu")`, then the loaded index is mutable and
compatible with the original hnswlib.

Saving / loading the index is experimental. The serialization format is
subject to change, therefore loading an index saved with a previous
version of cuVS is not guaranteed to work.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `index_params` | `IndexParams` | Parameters that were used to convert CAGRA index to HNSW index. |
| `filename` | `string` | Name of the file. |
| `dim` | `int` | Dimensions of the training dataest |
| `dtype` | `np.dtype of the saved index` | Valid values for dtype: [np.float32, np.byte, np.ubyte] |
| `metric` | `string denoting the metric type, default="sqeuclidean"` | Valid values for metric: ["sqeuclidean", "inner_product"], where - sqeuclidean is the euclidean distance without the square root operation, i.e.: distance(a,b) = \\sum_i (a_i - b_i)^2, - inner_product distance is defined as distance(a, b) = \\sum_i a_i * b_i. |
| `resources` | `cuvs.common.Resources, optional` |  |

**Returns**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `index` | `HnswIndex` |  |

**Examples**

```python
>>> import cupy as cp
>>> from cuvs.neighbors import cagra
>>> from cuvs.neighbors import hnsw
>>> n_samples = 50000
>>> n_features = 50
>>> dataset = cp.random.random_sample((n_samples, n_features),
...                                   dtype=cp.float32)
>>> # Build index
>>> index = cagra.build(cagra.IndexParams(), dataset)
>>> # Serialize the CAGRA index to hnswlib base layer only index format
>>> hnsw.save("my_index.bin", index)
>>> index = hnsw.load("my_index.bin", n_features, np.float32,
...                   "sqeuclidean")
```

## save

`@auto_sync_resources`

```python
def save(filename, Index index, resources=None)
```

Saves the CAGRA index to a file as an hnswlib index.
If the index was constructed with `hnsw.IndexParams(hierarchy="none")`,
then the saved index is immutable and can only be searched by the hnswlib
wrapper in cuVS, as the format is not compatible with the original hnswlib.
However, if the index was constructed with
`hnsw.IndexParams(hierarchy="cpu")`, then the saved index is mutable and
compatible with the original hnswlib.

Saving / loading the index is experimental. The serialization format is
subject to change.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `filename` | `string` | Name of the file. |
| `index` | `Index` | Trained HNSW index. |
| `resources` | `cuvs.common.Resources, optional` |  |

**Examples**

```python
>>> import cupy as cp
>>> from cuvs.neighbors import cagra
>>> n_samples = 50000
>>> n_features = 50
>>> dataset = cp.random.random_sample((n_samples, n_features),
...                                   dtype=cp.float32)
>>> # Build index
>>> cagra_index = cagra.build(cagra.IndexParams(), dataset)
>>> # Serialize and deserialize the cagra index built
>>> hnsw_index = hnsw.from_cagra(hnsw.IndexParams(), cagra_index)
>>> hnsw.save("my_index.bin", hnsw_index)
```

_Source: `python/cuvs/cuvs/neighbors/hnsw/hnsw.pyx:274`_

| `index` | `Index` | Trained HNSW index. |
| `queries` | `CPU array interface compliant matrix shape (n_samples, dim)` | Supported dtype [float, int] |
| `k` | `int` | The number of neighbors. |
| `neighbors` | `Optional CPU array interface compliant matrix shape` | (n_queries, k), dtype uint64_t. If supplied, neighbor indices will be written here in-place. (default None) |
| `distances` | `Optional CPU array interface compliant matrix shape` | (n_queries, k) If supplied, the distances to the neighbors will be written here in-place. (default None) |
| `resources` | `cuvs.common.Resources, optional` |  |

>>> dataset = cp.random.random_sample((n_samples, n_features),
...                                   dtype=cp.float32)
>>> # Build index
>>> index = cagra.build(cagra.IndexParams(), dataset)
>>> # Search using the built index
>>> queries = cp.random.random_sample((n_queries, n_features),
...                                   dtype=cp.float32)
>>> k = 10
>>> search_params = hnsw.SearchParams(
...     ef=200,
...     num_threads=0
... )
>>> # Convert CAGRA index to HNSW

## from_cagra

`@auto_sync_resources`

```python
def from_cagra(IndexParams index_params, cagra.Index cagra_index, temporary_index_path=None, resources=None)
```

Returns an HNSW index from a CAGRA index.

NOTE: When `index_params.hierarchy` is:

1. `NONE`: This method uses the filesystem to write the CAGRA index in
`/tmp/&lt;random_number&gt;.bin` before reading it as an hnswlib index, then
deleting the temporary file. The returned index is immutable and can only
be searched by the hnswlib wrapper in cuVS, as the format is not
compatible with the original hnswlib.
2. `CPU`: The returned index is mutable and can be extended with additional
vectors. The serialized index is also compatible with the original hnswlib
library.

Saving / loading the index is experimental. The serialization format is
subject to change.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `index_params` | `IndexParams` | Parameters to convert the CAGRA index to HNSW index. |
| `cagra_index` | `cagra.Index` | Trained CAGRA index. |
| `temporary_index_path` | `string, default = None` | Path to save the temporary index file. If None, the temporary file will be saved in `/tmp/&lt;random_number&gt;.bin`. |
| `resources` | `cuvs.common.Resources, optional` |  |

**Examples**

```python
>>> import cupy as cp
>>> from cuvs.neighbors import cagra
>>> from cuvs.neighbors import hnsw
>>> n_samples = 50000
>>> n_features = 50
>>> dataset = cp.random.random_sample((n_samples, n_features),
...                                   dtype=cp.float32)
>>> # Build index
>>> index = cagra.build(cagra.IndexParams(), dataset)
>>> # Serialize the CAGRA index to hnswlib base layer only index format
>>> hnsw_index = hnsw.from_cagra(hnsw.IndexParams(), index)
