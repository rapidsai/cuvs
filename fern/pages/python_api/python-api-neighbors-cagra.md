# Cagra

_Python module: `cuvs.neighbors.cagra`_

## AceParams

```python
cdef class AceParams
```

Parameters for ACE (Augmented Core Extraction) graph building algorithm.

ACE enables building indexes for datasets too large to fit in GPU memory by
partitioning the dataset using balanced k-means and building sub-indexes
for each partition independently.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npartitions` | `int, default = 0` | Number of partitions for ACE partitioned build. When set to 0 (default), the number of partitions is automatically derived based on available host and GPU memory to maximize partition size while ensuring the build fits in memory.<br /><br />Small values might improve recall but potentially degrade performance and increase memory usage. Partitions should not be too small to prevent issues in KNN graph construction. The partition size is on average 2 * (n_rows / npartitions) * dim * sizeof(T). 2 is because of the core and augmented vectors. Please account for imbalance in the partition sizes (up to 3x in our tests).<br /><br />If the specified number of partitions results in partitions that exceed available memory, the value will be automatically increased to fit memory constraints and a warning will be issued. |
| `ef_construction` | `int, default = 120` | The index quality for the ACE build. Bigger values increase the index quality. At some point, increasing this will no longer improve the quality. |
| `build_dir` | `str, default = "/tmp/ace_build"` | Directory to store ACE build artifacts (e.g., KNN graph, optimized graph). Used when `use_disk` is true or when the graph does not fit in host and GPU memory. This should be the fastest disk in the system and hold enough space for twice the dataset, final graph, and label mapping. |
| `use_disk` | `bool, default = False` | Whether to use disk-based storage for ACE build. When true, enables disk-based operations for memory-efficient graph construction. |
| `max_host_memory_gb` | `float, default = 0` | Maximum host memory to use for ACE build in GiB. When set to 0 (default), uses available host memory. Useful for testing or when running alongside other memory-intensive processes. |
| `max_gpu_memory_gb` | `float, default = 0` | Maximum GPU memory to use for ACE build in GiB. When set to 0 (default), uses available GPU memory. Useful for testing or when running alongside other memory-intensive processes. |

## build

`@auto_sync_resources`

```python
def build(IndexParams index_params, dataset, resources=None)
```

Build the CAGRA index from the dataset for efficient search.

The build performs two different steps- first an intermediate knn-graph is
constructed, then it's optimized it to create the final graph. The
index_params object controls the node degree of these graphs.

It is required that both the dataset and the optimized graph fit the
GPU memory.

Note: When using ACE (Augmented Core Extraction) build algorithm, the
dataset must be in host memory (CPU). The ACE algorithm is designed for
datasets too large to fit in GPU memory.

The following distance metrics are supported:
- L2
- InnerProduct
- Cosine

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `index_params` | `IndexParams object` |  |
| `dataset` | `CUDA array interface compliant matrix shape (n_samples, dim)` | Supported dtype [float, half, int8, uint8] **Note:** For ACE build algorithm, the dataset MUST be in host memory. Use NumPy arrays or call .get() on CuPy arrays before passing. |
| `resources` | `cuvs.common.Resources, optional` |  |

**Returns**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `index` | `cuvs.cagra.Index` |  |

**Examples**

```python
>>> import cupy as cp
>>> from cuvs.neighbors import cagra
>>> n_samples = 50000
>>> n_features = 50
>>> n_queries = 1000
>>> k = 10
>>> dataset = cp.random.random_sample((n_samples, n_features),
...                                   dtype=cp.float32)
>>> build_params = cagra.IndexParams(metric="sqeuclidean")
>>> index = cagra.build(build_params, dataset)
>>> queries = cp.random.random_sample((n_queries, n_features),
...                                   dtype=cp.float32)
>>> distances, neighbors = cagra.search(cagra.SearchParams(),
...                                      index, queries,
...                                      k)

## load

`@auto_sync_resources`

```python
def load(filename, resources=None)
```

Loads index from file.

Saving / loading the index is experimental. The serialization format is
subject to change, therefore loading an index saved with a previous
version of cuvs is not guaranteed to work.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `filename` | `string` | Name of the file. |
| `resources` | `cuvs.common.Resources, optional` |  |

## save

`@auto_sync_resources`

```python
def save(filename, Index index, bool include_dataset=True, resources=None)
```

Saves the index to a file.

Saving / loading the index is experimental. The serialization format is

| `filename` | `string` | Name of the file. |
| `index` | `Index` | Trained CAGRA index. |

Including the dataset in the serialized index will use extra disk space, and might not be desired if you already have a copy of the dataset on disk. If this option is set to false, you will have to call `index.update_dataset(dataset)` after loading the index. |
| `resources` | `cuvs.common.Resources, optional` |  |

**Examples**

```python

| `distances` | `Optional CUDA array interface compliant matrix shape` | (n_queries, k) If supplied, the distances to the neighbors will be written here in-place. (default None) |
| `filter` | `Optional cuvs.neighbors.cuvsFilter can be used to filter` | neighbors based on a given bitset. (default None) |
| `resources` | `cuvs.common.Resources, optional` |  |

**Examples**

```python
>>> import cupy as cp
>>> from cuvs.neighbors import cagra
>>> n_samples = 50000
>>> n_features = 50
>>> n_queries = 1000
>>> dataset = cp.random.random_sample((n_samples, n_features),
...                                   dtype=cp.float32)
>>> # Build index
>>> index = cagra.build(cagra.IndexParams(), dataset)
>>> # Search using the built index
>>> queries = cp.random.random_sample((n_queries, n_features),
...                                   dtype=cp.float32)
>>> k = 10
>>> search_params = cagra.SearchParams(
...     max_queries=100,
...     itopk_size=64
... )
>>> # Using a pooling allocator reduces overhead of temporary array
>>> # creation during search. This is useful if multiple searches
>>> # are performed with same query size.
>>> distances, neighbors = cagra.search(search_params, index, queries,
...                                     k)
>>> neighbors = cp.asarray(neighbors)
>>> distances = cp.asarray(distances)
```
