# Integrations

cuVS can be adopted at several layers of a vector-search stack. Applications can call cuVS directly, use a database or search engine with cuVS-backed indexing, rely on data platforms that bring NVIDIA accelerated computing closer to enterprise data, or use libraries that expose cuVS algorithms through familiar APIs.

This page summarizes where each integration fits and links to vendor documentation for setup, supported configurations, and operational details.

## Databases

Use these integrations when vector search should be managed by a database or search engine. The system owns ingestion, indexing, query APIs, and operations, while cuVS-backed paths accelerate supported index build or search workflows.

### Amazon OpenSearch Service

[Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/gpu-acceleration-vector-index.html) provides managed GPU acceleration for vector indexing on OpenSearch 3.1+ domains and OpenSearch Serverless vector collections. OpenSearch Service detects supported Faiss vector index builds, offloads the build work to managed GPU capacity, and applies acceleration to indexing and force-merge operations without requiring users to manage GPU instances. See the AWS docs for [enabling GPU acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/gpu-acceleration-enabling.html), [creating GPU-accelerated vector indexes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/gpu-acceleration-creating-indexes.html), and [indexing vector data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/gpu-acceleration-index-force-merge.html).

### CyborgDB

[CyborgDB](https://docs.cyborg.co/) is an encrypted vector database proxy for confidential vector search across backing stores such as PostgreSQL, Redis, S3, and in-memory storage. Cyborg and NVIDIA demonstrated a cuVS-accelerated proof of concept that speeds encrypted vector index build and retrieval while preserving CyborgDB's confidentiality model. See the CyborgDB [overview](https://docs.cyborg.co/versions/v0.16.x/intro/about), [quickstart](https://docs.cyborg.co/versions/v0.16.x/intro/quickstart), [embedded deployment docs](https://docs.cyborg.co/embedded), and NVIDIA's [Cyborg and cuVS technical blog](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/bringing-confidentiality-to-vector-search-with-cyborg-and-nvidia-cuvs/).

### Elasticsearch

[Elasticsearch GPU accelerated vector indexing](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/gpu-vector-indexing) uses NVIDIA cuVS to accelerate dense-vector HNSW index construction. This path is intended for ingestion-heavy workloads where CPU HNSW graph construction is a bottleneck. Elastic's implementation builds graph structures on the GPU and converts them for Elasticsearch search workflows. See Elastic's [GPU vector indexing reference](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/gpu-vector-indexing), plus the GPU acceleration writeups for [chapter 1](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/gpu-accelerated-vector-search-elasticsearch-nvidia/) and [chapter 2](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/elasticsearch-gpu-accelerated-vector-indexing-nvidia).

### Kinetica

[Kinetica](https://docs.kinetica.com/7.2/vector_search/) is a GPU-accelerated database with native vector columns, SQL vector operators, and Python APIs for vector search. Kinetica supports CAGRA indexes on vector columns for GPU-oriented approximate nearest-neighbor search, while HNSW remains the automatically maintained option for mutable vector data. See Kinetica's [CAGRA index docs](https://docs.kinetica.com/7.2/concepts/indexes/#cagra-index), [NVIDIA partner page](https://www.kinetica.com/partner/nvidia/), [vector I/O example](https://github.com/kineticadb/examples/blob/master/python_dev_guide/python_vector_io.ipynb), and [vector search example](https://github.com/kineticadb/examples/blob/master/python_dev_guide/python_vector_search.ipynb).

### Milvus

[Milvus GPU indexes](https://milvus.io/docs/gpu_index.md) provide GPU-accelerated options for high-throughput and high-recall vector search. Supported index types include [`GPU_CAGRA`](https://milvus.io/docs/gpu-cagra.md), [`GPU_IVF_FLAT`](https://milvus.io/docs/gpu-ivf-flat.md), [`GPU_IVF_PQ`](https://milvus.io/docs/gpu-ivf-pq.md), and [`GPU_BRUTE_FORCE`](https://milvus.io/docs/gpu-brute-force.md). `GPU_CAGRA` also supports hybrid deployments where a GPU-built graph can be adapted at load time for CPU search in Milvus 2.6.4 and newer. See the Milvus docs for [building indexes](https://milvus.io/docs/build_index.md) and [installing Milvus with GPU support](https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-docker-compose-gpu.md).

### OpenSearch

[OpenSearch Vector Engine](https://opensearch.org/platform/vector-search/) supports vector search, hybrid search, and RAG-oriented retrieval in OpenSearch. The OpenSearch GPU indexing design offloads vector index builds to GPU workers, uses cuVS through Faiss to build CAGRA graphs, converts those graphs into an HNSW-compatible form for CPU search, and falls back to CPU index building when needed. See the OpenSearch [vector search docs](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/vector-search/), [GPU-accelerated vector search blog](https://opensearch.org/blog/GPU-Accelerated-Vector-Search-OpenSearch-New-Frontier/), k-NN RFCs for [GPU acceleration](https://github.com/opensearch-project/k-NN/issues/2293) and [remote vector index build](https://github.com/opensearch-project/k-NN/issues/2294), and Amazon OpenSearch Service [GPU acceleration docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/gpu-acceleration-vector-index.html).

### Oracle AI Database 26ai

[Oracle AI Database 26ai](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/vecse/) includes Oracle AI Vector Search for storing embeddings, creating vector indexes, and running similarity search inside Oracle Database. Oracle's [Vector Index Service](https://www.oracle.com/database/private_ai_services_container/vector-indexes/) uses GPU-enabled containers and NVIDIA cuVS to generate Oracle In-Memory Neighbor Graph vector indexes, then returns the index to Oracle AI Database for query execution. See Oracle's [NVIDIA collaboration announcement](https://blogs.oracle.com/database/oracle-ai-database-nvidia-collaboration-advances-enterprise-ai-at-nvidia-gtc-2026), [Vector Index Service introduction](https://blogs.oracle.com/database/introducing-the-vector-index-service), and [getting started guide](https://blogs.oracle.com/database/getting-started-with-the-vector-index-service).

### Solr

[Apache Solr dense vector search](https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/query-guide/dense-vector-search.html#gpu-acceleration) can use cuVS through the `cuvs-lucene` vector format. Solr exposes this through `CuVSCodecFactory` and the [`CuVSCodec`](https://solr.apache.org/docs/10_0_0/modules/cuvs/org/apache/solr/cuvs/CuVSCodec.html) module, allowing CAGRA graph construction on GPU and serialization into an HNSW graph for search. The Solr guide covers setup steps, including the `cuvs` module jars, `knnAlgorithm="cagra_hnsw"` on `DenseVectorField`, and codec configuration in `solrconfig.xml`.

## Data Platforms

Use these integrations when data locality, storage throughput, and RAG pipeline architecture are central to the deployment. These platforms usually do not expose cuVS APIs directly; they bring NVIDIA accelerated computing, networking, and AI software closer to enterprise data through the [NVIDIA AI Data Platform](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-storage-industry-leaders-unveil-new-class-of-enterprise-infrastructure-for-the-age-of-ai) reference design.
