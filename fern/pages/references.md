Many state-of-the-art implementations of vector search, vector preprocessing, vector compression, and vector clustering algorithms influenced the creation of cuVS. These papers describe core algorithms and GPU primitives used throughout cuVS, from graph-based approximate nearest-neighbor search to clustering, sparse neighborhood methods, top-k selection, and filtered vector search.

Use this page when citing the research behind cuVS algorithms or when looking for deeper technical background on the methods implemented in the library.

## CAGRA: Highly Parallel Graph Construction and Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search for GPUs

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15136)

CAGRA introduces a GPU-accelerated graph construction and approximate nearest-neighbor search algorithm. It is the main research foundation for cuVS CAGRA, a graph-based vector search index optimized for fast GPU index build and high-throughput GPU search.

## Parallel Top-K Algorithms on GPU: A Comprehensive Study and New Methods

[Paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3581784.3607062)

This paper studies GPU top-k selection and introduces AIR top-K and GridSelect. Efficient top-k selection is a core primitive for nearest-neighbor search because search algorithms often need to keep only the best candidate neighbors out of a much larger set.

## Fast k-NN Graph Construction by GPU Based NN-Descent

[Paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3459637.3482344)

This paper adapts NN-Descent to GPU architecture for fast approximate k-nearest-neighbor graph construction. It provides background for cuVS NN-Descent and for workflows that use k-NN graphs as intermediate structures.

## cuSLINK: Single-linkage Agglomerative Clustering on the GPU

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16354)

cuSLINK reformulates single-linkage agglomerative clustering for the GPU. It connects clustering with nearest-neighbor graph construction, spanning trees, and dendrogram extraction, which makes it relevant to cuVS clustering and graph-building routines.

## VecFlow: A High-Performance Vector Data Management System for Filtered-Search on GPUs

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00812)
