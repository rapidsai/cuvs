# cuVS Rust Example

This template project provides a drop-in sample to for using cuVS in a rust project.

First, please refer to our [installation docs](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cuvs/stable/build.html#cuda-gpu-requirements) for the minimum requirements to use cuVS. Note that you will have to have the libcuvs.so and libcuvs_c.so binaries installed to compile this example project.

Once the minimum requirements are satisfied, this example template application can be built using 'cargo build', and this directory can be copied directly in order to build a new application with cuVS.
