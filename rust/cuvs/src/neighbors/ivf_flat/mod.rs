//! IVF-Flat: an inverted-file index over uncompressed ("flat") vectors. It
//! partitions the dataset into `n_lists` clusters and, at query time, scans only
//! the `n_probes` closest clusters — a simple knob to trade recall for speed.
//!
//! Build an [`Index`] from a dataset, then [`search`](Index::search) it with
//! device-resident queries and output buffers. Tensors are borrowed through the
//! `AsDlTensor` / `AsDlTensorMut` traits; see the [`dlpack`](crate::dlpack)
//! module for the tensor model and `examples/cagra.rs` for the same build/search
//! workflow.
