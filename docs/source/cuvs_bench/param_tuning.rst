cuVS Bench Parameter Tuning Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This guide outlines the various parameter settings that can be specified in :doc:`cuVS Benchmarks <index>` yaml configuration files and explains the impact they have on corresponding algorithms to help inform their settings for benchmarking across desired levels of recall.

cuVS Indexes
============

cuvs_brute_force
----------------

Use cuVS brute-force index for exact search. Brute-force has no further build or search parameters.

cuvs_ivf_flat
-------------

IVF-flat uses an inverted-file index, which partitions the vectors into a series of clusters, or lists, storing them in an interleaved format which is optimized for fast distance computation. The searching of an IVF-flat index reduces the total vectors in the index to those within some user-specified nearest clusters called probes.

IVF-flat is a simple algorithm which won't save any space, but it provides competitive search times even at higher levels of recall.

cuvs_ivf_pq
-----------

IVF-pq is an inverted-file index, which partitions the vectors into a series of clusters, or lists, in a similar way to IVF-flat above. The difference is that IVF-PQ uses product quantization to also compress the vectors, giving the index a smaller memory footprint. Unfortunately, higher levels of compression can also shrink recall, which a refinement step can improve when the original vectors are still available.

.. list-table::

cuvs_cagra
----------

CAGRA uses a graph-based index, which creates an intermediate, approximate kNN graph using IVF-PQ and then further refining and optimizing to create a final kNN graph. This kNN graph is used by CAGRA as an index for search.

.. list-table::

 * - Parameter

   - Default
   - Description

 * - `graph_degree`

   - [`IVF_PQ`, `NN_DESCENT`, `ACE`]
   - `IVF_PQ`
   - Algorithm to use for building the initial kNN graph, from which CAGRA will optimize into the navigable CAGRA graph

 * - `dataset_memory_type`
   - `build`
   - N
   - [`device`, `host`, `mmap`]
   - `mmap`
   - Where should the dataset reside?

 * - `npartitions`
   - `build`
   - N
   - Positive integer >0
   - 1
   - The number of partitions to use for the ACE build. Small values might improve recall but potentially degrade performance and increase memory usage. Partitions should not be too small to prevent issues in KNN graph construction. The partition size is on average 2 * (n_rows / npartitions) * dim * sizeof(T). 2 is because of the core and augmented vectors. Please account for imbalance in the partition sizes (up to 3x in our tests).

 * - `build_dir`
   - `build`
   - N
   - String
   - "/tmp/ace_build"
   - The directory to use for the ACE build. Must be specified when using ACE build. This should be the fastest disk in the system and hold enough space for twice the dataset, final graph, and label mapping.

 * - `ef_construction`
   - `build`
   - Y
   - Positive integer >0
   - 120
   - Controls index time and accuracy when using ACE build. Bigger values increase the index quality. At some point, increasing this will no longer improve the quality.

 * - `use_disk`
   - `build`
   - N
   - Boolean
   - `false`
   - Whether to use disk-based storage for ACE build. When true, forces ACE to use disk-based storage even if the graph fits in host and GPU memory. When false, ACE will use in-memory storage if the graph fits in host and GPU memory and disk-based storage otherwise.

 * - `query_memory_type`
   - `search`
   - N
   - [`device`, `host`, `mmap`]
   - `device`
   - Where should the queries reside?

 * - `itopk`
   - `search`
   - N
   - Positive integer >0
   - 64
   - Number of intermediate search results retained during the search. Higher values improve search accuracy at the cost of speed

 * - `search_width`
   - `search`
   - N
   - Positive integer >0
   - 1
   - Number of graph nodes to select as the starting point for the search in each iteration.

 * - `max_iterations`
   - `search`
   - N
   - Positive integer >=0
   - 0
   - Upper limit of search iterations. Auto select when 0

 * - `algo`
   - `search`
   - N
   - [`auto`, `single_cta`, `multi_cta`, `multi_kernel`]
   - `auto`
   - Algorithm to use for search. It's usually best to leave this to `auto`.

 * - `graph_memory_type`
   - `search`
   - N
   - [`device`, `host_pinned`, `host_huge_page`]
   - `device`
   - Memory type to store graph

 * - `internal_dataset_memory_type`
   - `search`
   - N
   - [`device`, `host_pinned`, `host_huge_page`]
   - `device`
   - Memory type to store dataset

The `graph_memory_type` or `internal_dataset_memory_type` options can be useful for large datasets that do not fit the device memory. Setting `internal_dataset_memory_type` other than `device` has negative impact on search speed. Using `host_huge_page` option is only supported on systems with Heterogeneous Memory Management or on platforms that natively support GPU access to system allocated memory, for example Grace Hopper.

To fine tune CAGRA index building we can customize IVF-PQ index builder options using the following settings. These take effect only if `graph_build_algo == "IVF_PQ"`. It is recommended to experiment using a separate IVF-PQ index to find the config that gives the largest QPS for large batch. Recall does not need to be very high, since CAGRA further optimizes the kNN neighbor graph. Some of the default values are derived from the dataset size which is assumed to be [n_vecs, dim].
