Lucene
------

An experimental Lucene connector for cuVS enables GPU-accelerated vector search indexes through Lucene. Initial benchmarks are showing that this connector can drastically improve the performance of both indexing and search in Lucene. This connector will continue to be improved over time and any interested developers are encouraged to contribute.

Install and evaluate the `lucene-cuvs` connector on `Github <https://github.com/SearchScale/lucene-cuvs>`_.
