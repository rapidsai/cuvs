IVF-Flat
========

IVF-Flat is an inverted file index (IVF) algorithm, which in the context of nearest neighbors means that data points are
partitioned into clusters. At search time, brute-force is performed only in a (user-defined) subset of the closest clusters.
In practice, this algorithm can search the index much faster than brute-force and often still maintain an acceptable
recall, though this comes with the drawback that the index itself copies the original training vectors into a memory layout
that is optimized for fast memory reads and adds some additional memory storage overheads. Once the index is trained,
this algorithm no longer requires the original raw training vectors.

IVF-Flat tends to be a great choice when

1. like brute-force, there is enough device memory available to fit all of the vectors
in the index, and
2. exact recall is not needed. as with the other index types, the tuning parameters are used to trade-off recall for search latency / throughput.

Filtering considerations
------------------------

IVF methods only apply filters to the lists which are probed for each query point. As a result, the results of a filtered query will likely differ signficiantly from the results of a filtering applid to an exact method like brute-force. For example. imagine you have 3 IVF lists each containing 2 vectors and you perform a query against only the closest 2 lists but you filter out all but 1 element. If that remaining element happens to be in one of the lists which was not proved, it will not be considered at all in the search results. It's important to consider this when using any of the IVF methods in your applications.


Configuration parameters
------------------------

Build parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 25 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Default
     - Description
   * - n_lists
     - sqrt(n)
     - Number of coarse clusters used to partition the index. A good heuristic for this value is sqrt(n_vectors_in_index)
   * - add_data_on_build
     - True
     - Should the training points be added to the index after the index is built?
   * - kmeans_train_iters
     - 20
     - Max number of iterations for k-means training before convergence is assumed. Note that convergence could happen before this number of iterations.
   * - kmeans_trainset_fraction
     - 0.5
     - Fraction of points that should be subsampled from the original dataset to train the k-means clusters. Default is 1/2 the training dataset. This can often be reduced for very large datasets to improve both cluster quality and the build time.
   * - adaptive_centers
     - false
     - Should the existing trained centroids adapt to new points that are added to the index? This provides a trade-off between improving recall at the expense of having to compute new centroids for clusters when new points are added. When points are added in large batches, the performance cost may not be noticeable.
   * - conservative_memory_allocation
     - false
     - To support dynamic indexes, where points are expected to be added later, the individual IVF lists can be imtentionally overallocated up front to reduce the amount and impact of increasing list sizes, which requires allocating more memory and copying the old list to the new, larger, list.


Search parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 25 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Default
     - Description
   * - n_probes
     - 20
     - Number of closest IVF lists to scan for each query point.

Tuning Considerations
---------------------

Since IVF methods use clustering to establish spatial locality and partition data points into individual lists, there's an inherent
assumption that the number of lists, and thus the max size of the data in the index is known up front. For some use-cases, this
might not matter. For example, most vector databases build many smaller physical approximate nearest neighbors indexes, each from
fixed-size or maximum-sized immutable segments and so the number of lists can be tuned based on the number of vectors in the indexes.

Empirically, we've found :math:`\sqrt{n\_index\_vectors}` to be a good starting point for the :math:`n\_lists` hyper-parameter. Remember, having more
lists means less points to search within each list, but it could also mean more :math:`n\_probes` are needed at search time to reach an acceptable
recall.


Memory footprint
----------------

Each cluster is padded to at least 32 vectors (but potentially up to 1024). Assuming uniform random distribution of vectors/list, we would have
:math:`cluster\_overhead = (conservative\_memory\_allocation ? 16 : 512 ) * dim * sizeof_{float})`

Note that each cluster is allocated as a separate allocation. If we use a `cuda_memory_resource`, that would grab memory in 1 MiB chunks, so on average we might have 0.5 MiB overhead per cluster. If we us 10s of thousands of clusters, it becomes essential to use pool allocator to avoid this overhead.

:math:`cluster\_overhead =  0.5 MiB` // if we do not use pool allocator


Index (device memory):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. math::

   n\_vectors * n\_dimensions * sizeof(T) +

   n\_vectors  * sizeof(int_type) +

   n\_clusters * n\_dimensions * sizeof(T) +

   n\_clusters * cluster_overhead`


Peak device memory usage for index build:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:math:`workspace = min(1GB, n\_queries * [(n\_lists + 1 + n\_probes * (k + 1)) * sizeof_{float}) + n\_probes * k * sizeof_{idx}])`

:math:`index\_size + workspace`
