cuVS: Vector Search and Clustering on the GPU
=============================================


Welcome to cuVS, the premier library for GPU-accelerated vector search and clustering! cuVS provides several core building blocks for constructing new algorithms, as well as end-to-end vector search and clustering algorithms for use either standalone or through a growing list of :doc:`integrations <integrations>`.

There are several benefits to using cuVS and GPUs for vector search, including

#. Fast index build
#. Latency critical and high throughput search
#. Parameter tuning
#. Cost savings
#. Interoperability (build on GPU, deploy on CPU)
#. Multiple language support
#. Building blocks for composing new or accelerating existing algorithms
